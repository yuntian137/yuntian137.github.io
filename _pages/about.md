# About Me

Hi, I'm **Chengyi Song (å®‹æ‰¿æ€¿)** ðŸ‘‹

[cite_start]I am an undergraduate student at the **South China University of Technology (SCUT)** [cite: 196, 255][cite_start], pursuing a B.Eng. in **Automation** with an expected graduation date of July 2026[cite: 198, 257]. [cite_start]I am also a member of the **"Everest Program" for Super Robotics** [cite: 199, 258][cite_start], an interdisciplinary elite program (30 students/cohort) focused on advanced robotics, AI, and control systems[cite: 199, 258].

[cite_start]My passion lies at the intersection of **robotics dynamics & control**, **embedded systems development**, and **ROS (Robot Operating System)**[cite: 248, 249, 259, 260]. [cite_start]I have gained extensive hands-on experience leading teams in the **RoboMaster University Championship** for two consecutive seasons [cite: 209, 218] [cite_start]and honed my embedded software skills during an internship at **Insta360**[cite: 202, 268].

I am actively seeking research or internship opportunities where I can contribute my skills to challenging problems in robotics and autonomous systems.
